My first project at CodeClan was to create a voting webapp using Ruby, Sinatra and PostgreSQL. The brief was that each pub in Edinburgh should be able to vote for three other pubs, and then display the pubs on a league table based on the number of votes they receive. There are restrictions in the rules, each but should NOT - 1. be able to vote for themselves - 2. be able to vote for the same pub more than once - 3. be able to vote more than once.
